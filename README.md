## Boids Simulation

The most notable feature of the site is the boids simulation that runs in the background of the `index.html` page.

### How it Works

It uses vanilla JavaScript and HTML5 canvas, and it is based on the [boids algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boids) created by Craig Reynolds in 1986. The algorithm simulates the flocking behavior of birds by having each boid follow three simple rules:

1. **Separation**: Boids avoid collisions with other boids by steering away from nearby boids.
2. **Alignment**: Boids align their velocity with nearby boids.
3. **Cohesion**: Boids move towards the average position of nearby boids.

## How to Run

1. Clone the repository:
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/Captainexpo-1/captainexpo-1.github.io.git
    ```
2. Open `index.html` in your web browser.
